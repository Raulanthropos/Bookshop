// which pieces of info can the reducer function use for computing
// the new application state?
// 1) the current state
// 2) the action that just got dispatched

// just like when initializing a component's state you need to think
// about the initial values, that rule is also valid for inizializing the
// redux store!

  // of the application

        // to an array. remember: NEVER mutate state in a reducer function,
        // that brakes the immutability patter of redux
        // check doesitmutate.xyz if you want to see which methods
